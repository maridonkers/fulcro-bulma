# org.photonsphere/fulcro.ui.bulma

A fulcro.ui.bootstrap3 inspired Clojure library for Bulma, to be used with Fulcro -- Mari Donkers (photonsphere.org).

## Rationale

A purposely 'thin' Clojure library for the lean CSS-only, [Flexbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flex_Box_Layout) based, [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) framework. Work in progress. Intention is to *not* implement the straight forward Bulma components and elements. For example rendering and adding ClojureScript to a Bulma button is relatively straightforward. More complex Bulma components, such as a Navbar and a Dropdown, will be supported by this library.

## Currently implemented Bulma components

* Navbar
* Dropdown
